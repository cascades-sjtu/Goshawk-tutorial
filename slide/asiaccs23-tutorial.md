# Connect to Goshawk server

Select a username from user001 to user100 and use this command:

```bash
ssh -p 12750 user001@sky.gossip.team # password: asiaccs2023
```

Everyone will have the following directories:
- Goshawk project
- Two C/C++ projects ready to be analyzed
- ...(Other C/C++ projects you like to analyze)

# Traditional memory corruption detection

- Create a **CFG** (control flow graph) & Scan the CFG - [ClangStaticAnalyzer MallocChecker](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/MallocChecker_8cpp_source.html)

The last step is the core idea - **simplifying CFG and data-flow analysis**

<!--
1. Segment and normalize function prototypes.
2. Convert function prototype into numeric vectors. 
3. Compute the similarity with the reference set.

# Goshawk Trophies

By the time of paper publication, Goshask has identified **10K+** custom MM functions, detected **92** new use-after-free and double-freebugs while kept a low FP rate.

# Motivation of tutorial

- Goshawk is still evloving
  - ported to Clang-15
  - more user-friendly run script
  - re-train script for other kinds of custom functions
- Goshawk has been applied to a wider range of softwares
  - **19** bugs (13 UAFs and 2 Double Frees) in 90 OpenWrt pacakges are discovered and confirmed
  - the average length of these bugs' data-flow trace is 16.86

# Software environment

- Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
- Python 3.10.6
- Bear 3.1.2
- Clang 15.0.0
- CodeChecker 6.22.1

# Useful Commands

- Get compilation database: `cd <project_path>; bear -- make CC=clang HOSTCC=clang`
- Identify MM functions: `cd <Goshawk_path>; python3 run.py -s=extract <project_path>`
- Dataflow analysis: `cd <Goshawk_path>; python3 run.py -s=analyze <project_path>`
