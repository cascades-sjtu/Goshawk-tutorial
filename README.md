# Goshawk-tutorial

Tutorial of <https://github.com/Yunlongs/Goshawk>, which is a static analyze tool to detect memory corruption bugs in C source codes.

## Summary

The static analysis identifies bugs without running the code. However, to find bugs in real-world complex software, even those modern static analysis tools suffer from scalability issues, and there still remains a huge gap between research-based analysis and practical bug detection. In this tutorial, we demonstrate Goshawk, a static analysis tool to find memory corruption bugs with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and our audiences are expected to

* leverage Goshawk to find memory-related bugs in real-world C/C++ projects in several minutes;
* learn how to utilize latest AI techniques to extend static code analysis.
